A Mind Mirror, Not Just a Log

## Do you ever end your day with a dozen unfinished tasks looping in your head? üß†üîÅ
It‚Äôs a real thing called the **Zeigarnik Effect**: our brains are wired to fixate on incomplete tasks, draining our mental energy long after we've logged off. The key to stopping the loop is closure.

I‚Äôve been working on a simple command-line script to practice this. It's not just another logging tool‚Äîit's a habit for gaining mental clarity.

I'm calling it Kensho (Ë¶ãÊÄß), a term for the experience of "seeing one's true nature."

**The Philosophy: A Mind Mirror, Not Just a Log**

A fitness tracker doesn't make you fit, but it makes your fitness visible.

In the same way, Kensho doesn't do your work, but it makes your mind visible. It‚Äôs a mirror reflecting your daily patterns, friction points, and moments of real momentum.

## The Habit: 5 Minutes to End the Loop
This isn't meant to be a chore. It‚Äôs a simple performance habit, not a rigid ritual.

3 quick bullet lists at the end of your day.
5 minutes, max.
Skip a day? No guilt. Just start again tomorrow.

## The Payoff: From Solo Insight to Team Velocity
While it begins as a tool for self-awareness, the benefits multiply when a team adopts the habit:

- Better standups: Everyone arrives already aligned.
- Fewer repeated investigations: A clear breadcrumb trail exists.
- More accurate retros: You track daily reality, not just filtered Jira tickets.

## And Then, Kensho Becomes Your Coach...
This is where the mirror talks back. Once a month, Kensho‚Äôs most powerful feature unlocks. Using the --monthly-summary command, it leverages the Gemini API to analyze all your logs and delivers a deep-dive report on your progress, patterns, and actionable advice for the month ahead.
